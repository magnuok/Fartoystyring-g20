%% calculate crab angle
% use equation 2.117 (assuming small angles)

U = sqrt(v.^2 + u.^2);
beta = v./U;



%% plot
% Show the problem by displaying a gure with the course ?, heading ?, desired course
% ?d (from the guidance system) and crab angle ? from the simulation results acquired in Task 2.2.
% Include the gure in the report and comment on the results.
